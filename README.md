# Simon-game-challenge
A fun and interactive memory game where the user competes against the system by matching a sequence of colors. The system selects and clicks a series of colors, and the user must replicate the exact sequence by remembering the system’s moves. As the game progresses, the sequences get longer, testing the player’s memory and focus.
